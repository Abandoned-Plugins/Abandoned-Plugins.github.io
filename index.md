# Abandoned Plugins

Abandoned Plugins supports the WordPress community by maintaining useful plugins that are no longer maintained by their original authors. I fork plugins with at least 5,000 active installations that haven't been updated in a while. I provide support, bug/security fixes, and ongoing maintenance.
